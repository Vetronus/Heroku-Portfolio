# Heroku Portfolio

### This WebApp is still incomplete. Use it on your own risk.

This repo is resting place of my personal portfolio website. It is hosted on Heroku. You will be able visit it on [Parth Sarthee](http://parthsarthee.com)which is currently unavailable. Right now, its being hosted on a Heroku domain on [This Link](https://vetronus.herokuapp.com/).

This portfolio theme is inspired from [Freelancer Theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme) by [Jerome Lachaud](https://github.com/jeromelachaud). Although the design is inspired by this great theme but please note that there is not a single code of that repository which is used in this project. After intense trying and failures, unable to deploy it on Heroku, I decide to recode it in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The only PHP file, index.php, is being used to fool the Heroku Server.

## Project

Sarthee. The design, however, is inspired from [Freelancer Theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme) by [Jerome Lachaud](https://github.com/jeromelachaud).
