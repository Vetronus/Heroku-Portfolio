# Heroku Portfolio

### This WebApp is still incomplete. Use it on your own risk.

This repo is resting place of my personal portfolio website. It is hosted on Heroku. You will be able visit it on [Parth Sarthee](http://parthsarthee.com)  which is currently unavailable. Right now, its being hosted on a Heroku domain on [This Link](https://vetronus.herokuapp.com/).

### Why I created this project ?
This portfolio theme is inspired from [Freelancer Theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme) by [Jerome Lachaud](https://github.com/jeromelachaud). After intense trying and failures, I was unable to deploy the great freelancer theme on Heroku, so I decide to recode it in pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The only PHP file(`index.php`) is being used to fool the Heroku Server. `Although the design is inspired by the cool freelancer theme, but please note that, there is not a single code of that repository which is used in this project.`
##### Thus I recoded the whole theme with pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Even without the JQuery !

## Project

This repo, project and website is created, coded and maintained by Parth
Sarthee. The design, however, is inspired from [Freelancer Theme](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme) by [Jerome Lachaud](https://github.com/jeromelachaud).
The technologies that are use:
- #### HTML-5
- #### CSS-3
- #### JavaScript
- #### Very-Very-Very Tiny PHP

This project is currently deployed  on Heroku and can be visited [here](https://vetronus.herokuapp.com/). Please note that the project is still unorganised and incomplete. I have plans to complete it by August 2017.

## How To Use
You don't need any backend or heavy front-end knowledge to modify this project simply replace the images in `img` folder, replace the texts in `index.html` file and edit some basic css if you want.
In future, I might write a descriptive, user-friendly and quick way to start using this project as your portfolio theme.
